# hello-world
testing the waters here at github

I was invited by a client to share my github ID and since I did not have one I came over here to get one and to dip my toes into the wordl of another new thing to learn. 
really excited to try this.

While I am a Wordpress designer and Dabbelin Graphics my main work is portrait Photography. Specializing in Children of all ages and Families.
